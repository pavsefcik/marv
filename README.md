# My Own Coding Agent

![my-own-coding-agent](docs/heading.png)

An educational, expandable coding‑agent harness built in Python.

It started as a single‑file agent built from notes and experiments, and grew into a full learning playground inspired by Codex, Open Code, Claude Code, and [Pi](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono). The goal here is simple: **learn how these systems work by building one** and then expand it with more bells and whistles over time. It's not the best, but it's mine.

## Why this exists

I read a [couple](https://ampcode.com/how-to-build-an-agent) of [posts](https://ghuntley.com/agent/) on building agents that made me want to own the full harness—not just use a product. I wanted something I could understand end‑to‑end, tweak freely, and grow as I learned. This project is the result: a readable, hackable agent loop with modular pieces I can keep expanding.

This is also a unique project in that it is self‑bootstrapped: I built the initial agent using Codex, then added the tools and loop needed for it to help build itself. Most new features are developed with the agent itself.

## What it provides

- Provider‑agnostic LLM support ([OpenAI](docs/llm.md#openai), [Anthropic](docs/llm.md#anthropic), and OpenAI‑compatible APIs like [OpenRouter](docs/llm.md#openrouter) and [Ollama](docs/llm.md#ollama))
- Streaming text + tool calls + thinking blocks
- Session persistence (JSONL) with forking and resuming
- Context compaction to stay inside token limits
- Skills system (Markdown + YAML frontmatter)
- Prompt templates with slash commands and argument substitution
- Extensions API with lifecycle events, runtime/session/model/tool controls, and delivery-provided UI hooks
- Interactive TUI (Textual) + headless CLI mode + local web delivery
- Config layering (global, project, env vars)
- Built‑in tool suite: read/write/edit/bash/grep/find/ls

## The agent loop in five steps

1. **Input intake & preprocessing**
   - Slash commands and templates (`/something`), skills (`$skill`), and input extensions are resolved before anything hits the model.
2. **Session + context guardrails**
   - The user message is persisted to the JSONL session; context is compacted if needed.
3. **Prompt construction & model stream**
   - System prompt is built from active tools + skills + context files; model response streams back events.
4. **Tool execution cycle**
   - Tool calls are parsed, validated, executed, and tool results are appended back into the conversation.
5. **Turn finalization**
   - Events are emitted, queued extension follow-up messages are drained, and token stats are updated.

## High‑level architecture

```
runtime/     Agent loop, sessions, context compaction, prompts
llm/         Provider adapters + streaming events
config/      Runtime config loading
tools/       Built‑in tool registry + implementations
skills/      Skill discovery + validation
prompts/     Prompt templates + argument expansion
extensions/  Event hooks + runtime/session/model/tool/UI host
tui/         Textual UI (interactive mode)
cli/         Typer command surface + headless/session helpers
web/         FastAPI + WebSocket delivery shell
```

## Quickstart

Requirements: Python 3.14+ and `uv`.

```bash
make deps
make run
```

Headless (single prompt):

```bash
make run-headless PROMPT="List all Python files"
```

Web delivery:

```bash
make run-web
```

## Development

```bash
make test
make lint
make format
```

Release check (lint + tests):

```bash
make can-release
```

## Built‑in tools

- `read` – read file contents with line numbers
- `write` – create/overwrite files
- `edit` – find/replace edits
- `bash` – run shell commands
- `grep` – regex search across files
- `find` – glob‑based file discovery
- `ls` – directory listings

## Skills

Skills are Markdown files with YAML frontmatter. Invoke them with `$skill-name` to inject curated instructions into the prompt. Skill discovery respects user, project, and custom directories (see `docs/skills.md`).

## Prompt templates

Prompt templates are Markdown files invoked with `/template-name args...` and support `$1`, `$@`, `${@:2}` style substitution (see `docs/prompts.md`).

## Extensions

Extensions can:

- Block or transform input
- Modify context before the LLM call
- Intercept tool calls/results
- Register new tools and slash commands
- Inspect and mutate session/model/tool state through `ctx`
- Use delivery-provided UI helpers like `notify`, `input`, `confirm`, `select`, `present`, and `set_widget`

See `docs/extensions.md` for the API shape.
